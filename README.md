# RE-MP - A GTA SA Remastered multiplayer mod

Just a small project i've been working on reverse engineering GTA SA remastered. 

The project includes:
- DirectX renderer using ImGui
- Detour hooking some functions
- Removing PED and vehicle spawns
- Unreal SDK implementation (but mostly not even need to be used)

# Usage?
Feel free to use it like you want. I've been working on it for a few hours but lost interest after seeing how many "failed" MP mods are out there and the community is not interested into having another mod or even want to play other SAMP like multiplayers.
